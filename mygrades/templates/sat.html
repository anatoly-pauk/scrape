How to Register
If you’re 12 years old or younger, you can only register by mail because of Internet privacy laws.
If you’re 13 or older, you can create a free College Board account and register online.
If you’re in the eighth grade or below you should not include a photo with your registration. However, you will need to have an acceptable photo ID to be admitted to the test center. There are also special rules about scores for eighth graders and below.
Talent Search Candidates
If you’re taking the SAT as part of a talent search program, you will need to submit other documentation in addition to your registration. For details, visit the program’s website:
</p>
<p>
Center for Talented Youth (Johns Hopkins University)
Duke Talent Identification Program (Duke University)
Midwest Academic Talent Search (Northwestern University)
Center for Bright Kids (Western Academic Talent Search)
If you’re in the eighth grade or below on test day, and you’re testing for Talent Search purposes, you can present a Talent Search Program ID Form instead of a photo ID.
